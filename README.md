Challenges:

Release Version Against Debug: One of the first challenges encountered was accidentally using the debug version of the app to generate the APK file. Debug builds are used for testing and may contain additional debug files that can affect the performance and size of the final build.
This was identified as an issue during testing because the performance of the app is the best compared to the expected release version.

### Test errors and poor performance:

To overcome debug vs debug issue. release the build, the following steps are taken:

Check the build variable: Double create the build variable in your project to make sure the build is set correctly. This includes verifying the Gradle configuration and making sure the appropriate build is selected.

Configuration Fix: After identifying the problem, make any necessary adjustments to the build to ensure that the build is configured correctly.
This includes removing unnecessary debugging code, optimizing the code, and reducing the size of the application by removing unused resources.
Evaluation and Verification: The update is tested on different devices and conditions to ensure it meets the requirements.

### Helpers and Alternative Libraries:
 During the development of, many libraries and tools were used to improve the performance and user experience of the application. Some of the highlights include:

 Maps API: This library provides the functionality needed to integrate and display historical locations on a map.
Retrofit: Used to manage network requests and provide data from backend servers or APIs.
Empowering simplifies the process of obtaining data sources and communicating efficiently with servers.

Glide: Allow optimized retrieval and display of image location history in the app for image loading and caching.

Education: The development and placement of
historic sites provided great insight and learning. Some important applications include:

### Build Issues: 
Understanding the difference between debug and release builds, and how to structure your project for each, is important to improve application performance and improve user experience.

Version Control: Use control systems like Git and GitHub to facilitate effective collaboration, code control, and distribution of documents for end users.

Library integration: The use of external libraries simplifies the development process, reduces the need to redo the wheel, and allows rapid implementation of existing functions in the application.

User-Centered Design: By creating screen recordings that demonstrate the app's functionality, users can better understand the app's capabilities and potential benefits, thereby increasing app appeal and adoption.

## Conclusion: 
Creating and deploying source history files using Kotlin presents a number of challenges, including debugging and publishing issues. Through careful analysis, configuration tuning and rigorous testing, design issues are successfully resolved to ensure the best performance for end users.
The use of libraries and additional tools improves the functionality and user experience of the application. Lessons learned from this project highlighted the importance of development, version control, library integration, and client-side design.
